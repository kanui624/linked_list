# After reading through the linked list overview documentation, I know that a
# linked lists consist of a set of 'nodes' or pieces of data the conatain both
# data and a reference to the next node in line. 

# Kanui Pseudo Kode

# Consider the index of each node, then 
  # Alter the index of each node, to be in reverse order, then 
    # Output the nodes in the new reversed order 

# Kanui Psuedo Kode - Abstraction 1

# Create a loop that will iterate over each of the nodes, then 
  # Create a conditional statement stating that if the value = nil place at the end of the list, then 
    # Create a method to re-order the node given there reference position
